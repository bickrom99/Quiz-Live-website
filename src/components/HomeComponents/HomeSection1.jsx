                    A live quiz can don many hats. It can take on the shape of a bell ringer, an entry or exit ticket, a revision activity, an ice breaker, or a formative assessment. Playing an online quiz live can offer an added benefit here. It enables you to experiment with multimedia, by adding audio-visual elements to captivate your students.
